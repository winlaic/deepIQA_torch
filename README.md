## deepIQA model implemented on Pytorch

**Warning! This code is not a completed version!**

Division method of the dataset is **wrong**. 
If you have downloaded the model, **DO NOT** use it for evaluation!
If you want to use the code right now, please rewrite the code in `dataset.py` for metadata generating.

I will soon complete and repost the complete version.

I'm so sorry about the inconvenience!
